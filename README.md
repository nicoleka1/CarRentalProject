### Design
This section outlines the design principles and guidelines that ensure our corporate identiy is consistenly reflected across our application. The L&N CARRENTAL logo features a sleek, modern car silhouette combined with the company name. The logo colors are grey and two nuances of turquoise, reflecting our brandâ€™s identity.

![](images/LogoCarRental.png)

#### Color Scheme
The primary colors are grey and turquoise the secondary colors are shades of dark turquoise. Some accent colors in turquoide are additionally used.

#### Graphics
We used custom-designed icons in turquoise shades to maintain consistency. Icons should be minimalistic and align with the overall dark theme of the website. High-quality images of cars with a dark filter overlay to blend seamlessly into the dark-themed layout.

#### Layout
There is a fixed horizontal navigation on the top. With a home screen and to sections "UserSpace" and "AdminSpace. The two space section are nested navigation element which provide by clicking further screens.

#### User Esperience (UX)
It is ensured that the website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across all devices. The navigation is keept simple and intuitive, with clear labels. Buttons, forms, and other interactive elements should have clear, responsive feedback.

Our dark-themed, turquoise-accented design provides a modern and elegant user experience, while our commitment to usability and accessibility ensures that every visitor can easily find and rent their perfect car. 

### Wireframe
Here is an overview of our wireframes which we have created with draw.io. Please zoom in to be able to read it. :)

![](images/Wireframes.drawio.png)

### Prototype Design
The prototypes were developed in the low-code tool BudiBase and then progressively expanded and improved through the project work.

### Domain Design

We created an Entity-Relationship Model in Visual Paradigm.

#### Entities

Admins: Represents the administrators of the website.

Users: Represents individuals who interact with the application.

Cars: Represents the vehicles for rental.

Locations: Represents the rental locations where cars can be rented.

Rentals: Represents a rental transaction.


#### Relationships

##### Admin â€“ User (UserManagement)
One-to-Many relationship indicates that an admin can edit multiple users.

##### Admin â€“ Car (CarManagement)
One-to-Many relationship indicates that an admin can edit multiple cars.

##### User â€“ Rental (MakeRental)
One-to-Many relationship indicating that a user can make multiple rentals, but each rental is associated with only one user.

##### Car â€“ Rental (IsRentedFor)
One-to-Many relationship indicating that a car can be rented multiple times, but each rental is associated with only one car.

##### Rental â€“ Location (TakesPlaceAt)
Many-to-One relationship: Many rentals can take place ate the same rental location, but each rental only takes place at  only one location.

##### Location â€“ Car (IsLocatedAt)
One-to-Many relationship indicating that a location can have multiple cars available for rental, but each car is located at only one location.

#### Model

### Business Logic
> Our APIs are available in the swagger endpoint. The default Swagger US page is available at /swagger-ui.html.
>
> Based on UC-5, there will be all available cars in a specified period of time:
>
> ...
>
> Based on UC-6, there will be information about the frequency of rented cars (entities involved: cars and rentals):
>
> ...

## Implementation
To achieve the overall project goals for L&N CARRENTAL, we utilized a diverse set of applications and technologies, each serving a specific purpose in the development and enhancement of our website.

We used Visual Paradigm to create the entity relationship model. With the support of the tool draw.io we have worked out our wireframes. The logo was designed with Microsoft Powerpoint and uploaded to imgbb, to be able to implement it in Budibase. 

We have created a group workspace in Postman to test our APIs. GitHub was used for version control, code repository management, and collaboration among the development in our small team. GitHub Codespaces provided a cloud-based development environment that allowed us to develop and test code from anywhere, ensuring consistent setups and configurations. GitHub Copilot was used to enhance developer productivity by providing AI-powered code suggestions and completions, speeding up our coding process and reducing errors.

### Backend Technology
> As suggested we cloned the Pizza Reference Project to start, so did we. Our Web application relies on Spring Boot and the dependency to Spring Data,, Java Persistence API (JPA) and H2 Database. To bootstrap the application the Spring Initializr has been used.
>
Then, the following further dependencies are added to the project `pom.xml`:

- DB:
```XML
<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

- SWAGGER:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
      <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
```

### Frontend Technology
Our Web application was developed using Budibase.

Our views and which APIs were used in which view are described below.

#### Home
- API: GET 00_Welcome_Page - {{URL}}
  
On our Home (/home) screen our customers and admins are welcomed.
![](images/HomePage.png)

#### User
The drop-down menu "UserSpace" allows the user to navigate to different screens.
![](images/NavigationUserSpace1.png)

##### Home (/userhome --> /availablecars || --> /contactus)
The customer gets information about the page. He can directly navigate to Available Cars or Contact Us.

##### Login (/loginuser)
- API: POST 01_auth_my_user - {{URL}}/authentication/token

The user is provided with a login form. The user can log in with username and password. Through the POST method the token is retrieved and should be stored to enable only the sections on the page which are configured for the user. If no input is made in the username field or password field a validation error message pops up.

##### Available Cars (/availablecars)
- API: GET 07_GetAvailableCars with Bindings - {{URL}}/cars/available-cars?startDate={{Binding.startDate}}&endDate={{Binding.endDate}}

The user can pick a start and an end date for the rental. The selected dates are stored in a state and binded to the filter parameters in the query. In the backend on Postman and on Budibase it is working properly. In the frontend the state is updated but the query is not able to accept the state. We are thinking to solve the issue with an JavaScript code but we did not figured out yet. There is a table provided to list all available cars in the respectitive period of time.
 
##### Contact Us (/contactus)
Several information is provided to contact us as well as a contact form (no functional implementation).
 
##### About Us (/aboutus)
Several information about our company is provided.

#### Admin
The drop-down menu "AdminSpace" allows the user to navigate to different screens.

## Execution
> To run our application the URL in Budibase must be changed. Start the codespace in CarRentalPorject and run the CarApplication.java. The port 8080 must be set to public. And the URL can be set as a stati variable in Budibase.

## Deployment to a PaaS
Deployment to Platform as a Service (PaaS) is optional but recommended for making the application backend accessible without server restarts and providing a unique, constantly available link. However, due to our very small team, we decided not to pursue PaaS deployment at this stage.

## Project Management
We attemded the lectures practically every week in order to acquire the theoretical knowledge. Unfortunately, the lessons were not enough and we had to invest a lot of time to get an overview of how the back- and the frontend should work.

In the beginning, we did everything together. After a cetain time, we specialised a bit more, Nicole on the backend and Lea on the frontend. We agreed on personal milestones and then worked them out individually and discussed the outcome and problems together. As a result, each of us also took on an advisory role in the other's part. The group work worked very well. We managed our communication via Whatsapp and a Microsoft Teams channel that we created for the module Internet Technology. Each of us made an effort and saw what still needed to be done and tackled this independently. Next time we would start a little earlier, but we believe that the course structure slowed this down a little. It would have helped us to take a closer look at the backend first and then start with the frontend.

We are looking forward to further projects together!
